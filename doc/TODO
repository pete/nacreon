This list is reasonably unordered, and parts of it are speculative (i.e., the
parts with question marks or "perhaps" in them).  It represents what we plan to
do to Nacreon in the near term.

* Clean up Bundler support. (gem mirror to speed it up, put bundling somewhere
that speed isn't as critical, as a stopgap until "slugs" are implemented.)
* Automatic scaling.
* Clean up the tests. (Procfiles/foreman?)  Add more integration tests.
* Ruby 1.8 app support.
* Non-Ruby app support (Procfiles/foreman?)
* Clean up things dumped unceremoniously in /tmp; use /var, etc., un-hard-code
some paths.
* Storing fresh application directories (as in Heroku's "slugs") to speed up
deployment.  
* LXC support for process jailing under Linux; make optional so that development
on OSX can continue.  (Perhaps support DragonflyBSD jails, should someone
develop the spare time for this.)  Possibly utilize union mounts/overlays.
* Tarball distribution to support AppManager daemons.  (S3-compatible, likely,
and a transition to "slugs")
* Load-balancing between multiple instances of the AppManager.
* Push all of the auth stuff into Rack middleware.
* Isolate support.
* Better support for log access for clients.
* Tighter user access controls.
